scoop-python
============

scoop specific python versions..

A [Scoop](http://scoop.sh) bucket of many versions of Python. This makes it easy to switch between Python 2 and 3, for instance.

To make it easy to install apps from this bucket, run:

    > scoop bucket add python https://github.com/kodybrown/scoop-python

## Why does this exist?

For an app to be acceptable for the main bucket, it should be:

* open source
* a command-line program
* the latest stable version of the program
* reasonably well-known and widely used

The "extras" bucket has more relaxed requirements, so it's a good place to put anything that doesn't quite fit in the main bucket.

The "python" bucket is specifically to allow switching between the many versions of Python.
